# Hyper-V-Largelab
Creates Hyper-V Lab with placeholders DC, Fileserver and a few desktop vms 
This powershell script creates the Hyper-v infrastructure for a full lab with a Domain Controller, file Server and a few desktops.

Please note that this lab does not build any of the servers or handle any Hyper-v switches, or ther Hyper-v infrastructure.  

This buildout create placeholders for server that will then require manual builds and adjustments to the networks and ISOs which should already be in place.
